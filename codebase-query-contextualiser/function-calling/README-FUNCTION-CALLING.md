# Simple File Traversal Method | Function Calling

A system for intelligently traversing and analyzing files in a codebase, similar to how a human developer would navigate through code.

## Core Capabilities

1. **File Operations**
   - Open specific files
   - Read file contents
   - Parse and understand different file formats (code, markdown, config files, etc.)

2. **Intelligent Navigation**
   - Analyze file contents to determine related files that need to be examined
   - Follow imports, references, and dependencies
   - Understand project structure and relationships between files

3. **Context-Aware Analysis**
   - Perform searches with human-like understanding
   - Consider context when analyzing code
   - Make intelligent decisions about which files are relevant
   - Understand code patterns and conventions

4. **Use Cases**
   - Code review and analysis
   - Documentation generation
   - Dependency tracking
   - Impact analysis for code changes
   - Bug tracking across multiple files

5. **Features**
   - Recursive file traversal
   - Content-based file discovery
   - Smart file relationship mapping
   - Context preservation during traversal
   - Flexible search patterns

## How It Works

1. Start with an initial file
2. Parse and analyze its contents
3. Identify references to other files
4. Make intelligent decisions about which files to examine next
5. Build a comprehensive understanding of the codebase
6. Perform requested operations with full context

This approach mimics how a developer would naturally explore and understand a codebase, making it particularly effective for complex analysis tasks.
